_unfurl.nvim_ is a Neovim plugin designed to simplify the creation of Markdown
links from YouTube videos and general web pages. It extracts video information
or webpage titles and formats them into Markdown links, making it easy to
reference content directly within your notes or documentation.

## Features

- _YouTube Video Links_: Extracts the video ID and title from a given YouTube
  URL and generates a formatted Markdown link.

- _YouTube Timestamp Links_: Creates a Markdown link to a specific timestamp in
  a YouTube video, allowing direct references to specific moments in the video.

- _Webpage Links_: Fetches the title of any given URL and constructs a Markdown
  link that includes both the domain and the page title.
